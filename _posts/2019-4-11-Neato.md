I had an older Neato Botvac that recently died.  The brushless motor that powers the LIDAR it uses for navigation finally wore out.  I was really happy with the device and used it regularly for several years.  It was time for an upgrade anyway.

Their new Botvacs are all API controlled through a phone app.  They provide some tools to access this API which I'm exploring now.  Hoping to have something worth uploading "soon".

In other news - I'm continuing to make small tweaks to fix bugs, add convenience features throughout.  I've upgraded packages on my running instance and see that Buffer had been deprecated.  I finally got around to fixing that.

If you were logging data with PowerView blinds, I've changed the schema that may invalidate the states stored.  I made this logged schema uniform with Nest and SmartThings for easier parsing by the machine learning.

My next bit of work will be improving AI device controls.
